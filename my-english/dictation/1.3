- Conan and Karan the Greedy,retired teachers and teenistist and global travelers.
` I think we are typically (empty nerse)-[don't know],we have two children ,twins, Briana and Breedy,they are twenty you know.
When they both left home just 2 years ago,our house feels really big and empty,it was just the two of us. It was too quiet.
We missed all their noise,their music and their friends.`
` Even missed their mess`
` Not so sure about it`
` Briana went to London to study music, and Breedy went to South America ,he used to drowning there with their friends`
` So I said to Karen,why don't we go to travelling too. `
` Yeah, we were both nearly 60 but we are still feel young and we didn't enjoy teaching anymore, teaching teenagers is really tiring`
` So in just 6 month,we retired from our teaching jobs,
   ran to the house in Porosh,to the nice young couple,
   and we bought a second-hand camper van for thousands pounds and set all of the friends`
` Last year,we just to Europe,we went from countryside to countryside.First in France,then in Spain and Potrical.
  We loved every minute,we had a great time`
` Next year ,we going to visit Briana in Itally, she's going to study in Miland,
  and then we gonna fly to Chilly,hire a van there and meet Breedy. We gonna travel with hime and friends there a bit.`
` We are really excited about it,we can't wait.`
